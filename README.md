- 👋 Hi, I’m @missFixIt
- 👀 I’m interested in updating my HTML, CSS, JS, and React skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React by taking the Meta Front-End Developer course on Coursera.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on apps and websites, whatever I can get my hands into! I love to build and fix things. I've been building websites since the 90s, but not in the last 10 years. Pleased to see a lot of sensible changes and additions, like semantic HTML and grid and flex layouts in CSS. I learned to code inside Flash with Actionscript, parlayed that into Javascript, and now am learning React.
- 📫 How to reach me ...email valeriegwenn@yahoo.com
