- 👋 Hi, I’m @missFixIt
- 👀 I’m interested in HTML, CSS, JS, and React. I'd love to delve into back-end, maybe with Python and/or SQL.
- 🌱 I recently completed the Meta Front-End Developer Certificate course on Coursera. I'm building a silly app using React, and coding a few websites for friends. Currently learning Bootstrap, Motion Framer in React, and Matter js.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on apps and websites, whatever I can get my hands into! I love to build and fix things, in code and in real life, which is how I got my nickname. I've been building websites since the 90s. I learned to code inside Flash with Actionscript, parlayed that into Javascript, and now am working with React. I love learning because the more I know, the more I comprehend how vast an ocean of knowledge is still left for me to explore.
