- 👋 Hi, I’m @missFixIt
- 👀 I’m interested in HTML, CSS, JS, and React. I'd love to delve into back end, maybe with Python and/or SQL.
- 🌱 I recently completed the Meta Front-End Developer Certificate course on Coursera.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on apps and websites, whatever I can get my hands into! I love to build and fix things. I've been building websites since the 90s. I learned to code inside Flash with Actionscript, parlayed that into Javascript, and now am working with React. The more I know, the more I realize how much there still is to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me ...email valeriegwenn@yahoo.com
